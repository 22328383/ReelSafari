the main game loop is going to the water and clicking on the water to cast your rod.
then letting go of the left click once a fish is caught. then depending on your
rod and other factors we can add later (weather, bait type, items etc etc) we rng
a random fish/loot fished up and generate a weight associated with it. items and fish
have different rarity so it should feel like gambiling.
based on the fish you caught, the price of the fish is determined by the weight and rarity of the item.
with the money you can buy better gear to increase odds or asthetics. the game ends when you collect
enough money to "prestige" permanently making your odds better but reseting all progress.
